    "Will a patient be a long-term or short-term stay on their initial admin?\n",

    "To make it more apparent how this will be answered with logistic regression - we will define longterm stay as >7 days. Then we can use feature engineering to classify the patients that we have data on. Therefore - a True value would be a long-term stay and a False value would be short-term. We have implemented something similar on my team at work. It uses a more advanced classification model, but we have implemented the model for hospice patients. We found it far more beneficial in a clinical setting and more accurate than attempting to estimate the actual number of days a patient would be in hospice. Kind of morbid, but it does help greatly in informing care strategy."

    "The ultimate goal of my data analysis will be to identify key features in classifying patients as long-term or short-term stay patients. This is a slight itteration (or generalization - depending on how you view it) on the linear model that I implemented in the first assessment. The ideal outcome would be to implement this model in a clinical setting in a way that can inform patient care. From attending nursing school - it is well known in the medical space that a patients perception of the environment can greatly impact recovery. If a caretaker knows that a patient is going to spend an extended time in their care - it may be beneficial to make certain changes in the way they are cared for. Can we be less aggressive in our assessments to allow them time to rest? Can we have their family bring in things from home that make them feel comfortable? Can we have better continuity of care so they have time to build relationships with their care team? Can we stagger procedures to reduce stress? All of these are critical decisions that can greatly impact patient outcomes. If a patient can be classified based off of data gathered during an initial assessment - the decisions can be made earlier and hopefully improve patient outcomes and experience."

    "There are 5 basic assumptions within the implementation of a logistic regression model. The assumptions are as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Response variable is binary: In simplest terms - this going to mean that our dependent vraible has one of two outcomes. One outcome is going to be affirmative and one will indicate opposition. Some examples of that would 1 and 0, or True and False, etc.. In our research question - this will be indicated by long-term stay or short-term stay. Our affirmative response being long-term.</li>\n",
    "<li>Observations are independent: This is going to mean that our observations are not repeating. We are not going to have duplicate individuals. Each person gets one measurement and one measurement only.</li>\n",
    "<li>No Multicollinearity in Independent Variables: This assumption has a big word, so it is perhaps the most intimidating at this juncture. However, I believe it is easiest to understand with an example from our current dataset. When choosing variables to feed our model - we are looking for variables that provide unique information. Variables that provide unique variance. Take a look at initial days and total charge. Their variance is almost identical. However, when you stop to think about it - that makes perfect sense! They are effectively communicating the same and the longer you stay in the hospital - the more it is going to cost.</li>\n",
    "<li>No Extreme Outliers: This is going to be true for most predictive analytics. Edge cases will not benefit a model and may only serve to confuse a given model.</li>\n",
    "<li>Sufficient Sample Size: A logistic model is going to assume that there is an appropriate amount of observervations for different outcomes within our independent variables. The more rare a given outcome - the the fewer observations needed. The calculation to decide if we do in fact have a large enough sample size is the number of independent variables (i.e. 7) multiplied by 10 and divided by the probablity of the least frequent outcome (i.e. 30%). Written out - this would like (7*10)/.30 = 233. So, in this instance - we would need 233 observations of our rare combination.\n",

    "I have utilized Python for all of my projects leading up to this point. The most base reasoning for that is its flexibility. In a real world setting - it is significantly to implement systems built in Python. In theory it would allow us to easily build applications for end users to interact with our outcomes. Python is far more prevelant in environments where scalability is a consideration (i.e. hospitals). Within the market - R tends to be more niche for academia and pure statistics. My team and I have utilized R from time to time, but that is mostly in one-time analysis problem sets where we are less concerned with the deliverable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of its flexibility - there is also an awesome community of people who dedicate a lot of time to developing packages for Python. A nice explanation of some packages that will be seen within this project can be found here: https://towardsdatascience.com/3-top-python-packages-to-learn-statistic-for-data-scientist-d753b76e6099. Leveraging these packages gives me, as an end-user, a very easy interface to perform my analysis. Using Scikit-Learn, you could very easily instantiate and train a model in just a few lines of code! Pandas and Numpy give me a great interface to ask, and answer, questions of my data. The dataframe implementation makes data feel familiar in its tabular form. Finally, packages like Seaborn and Matplotlib give great visualizations that can be created in just a single line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short - I find Python to be flexible, yet powerful. The syntax is second nature and allows me to make data meaningful to an external stakeholder. I can give them ways to touch and tinke with data, that don't require them to have knowledge of a programming language. Throw a plotly visualization into a quick flask app - suddenly you have an interactive playground for data. And, all of it can be done in less than 50 lines of code."

    "My research question is simply trying to categorize patients. Is this patient going to be here for an extended period of time? Yes or no? 1 or 0? Logistic regression is utilized within these types of problem sets. It is a model that seeks to categorize observations based upon historical data. Within a clinical setting - it gives caretakers the ability to make quick decisions. Were this to be applied in a real world scenario - we could present a simple yes or no prediction within a patients chart. Do we expect this patient to be with us for a time greater than a week? Yes or no? That type of quick data point can inform everything from the first to the last interaction and it can be communicated very quickly. It isn't ambiguous. There is no middle ground.\n",

    "This will mark the midway point for my data preparation. Given pre-existing knowledge of the dataset - I am aware that it is clean and has no need for imputation (no missing values). However, I have made a few adjustments to the data to better fit my preference. I find that having numeric values is easier to work with in the totality of a given project. It also communicates an ordinal value for model to better interpret relationship. Additionally - I have converted Yes and No values to binary values. While not necessarily required for specific models - it does keep interactions more consistent. Following that step - I went ahead with our feature engineering to generate the long-term and short-term categorization of our existing records. Post this commentary - I will implement feature scaling to limit impact of different scales amongst the different variables. Then I will split the dataset into a training and test set to allow for validation of the model. Additionally, I will run some checks to ensure that logistic regression assumptions are met (namely multicolinearity). The goals and preparation will remain similar to the previous to our previous implementation of linear regression.\n",
